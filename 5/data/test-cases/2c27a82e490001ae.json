This policy helps to maintain a secure environment by enforcing password complexity and expiration rules.\n\n#### Request Body Parameters:\n\n1. **`minimumLength`** (Integer):  \n    Specifies the minimum required length for user passwords.  \n    **Example**: `8` – Password must be at least 8 characters long.\n    \n2. **`maximumLength`** (Integer):  \n    Specifies the maximum allowable length for user passwords.  \n    **Example**: `16` – Password can be a maximum of 16 characters long.\n    \n3. **`maxFailedLoginAttempts`** (Integer):  \n    The maximum number of failed login attempts allowed before the account is locked or other security measures are triggered.  \n    **Example**: `3` – The user account will be locked after 3 failed login attempts.\n    \n4. **`passwordReuseCount`** (Integer):  \n    Defines how many previous passwords a user must cycle through before reusing the same password.  \n    **Example**: `1` – Users cannot reuse their last password.\n    \n5. **`minLowerCaseLength`** (Integer):  \n    The minimum number of lowercase letters required in the password.  \n    **Example**: `1` – Password must contain at least one lowercase letter.\n    \n6. **`minSpecialCharacters`** (Integer):  \n    The minimum number of special characters (such as `@`, `#`, `$`) required in the password.  \n    **Example**: `1` – Password must contain at least one special character.\n    \n7. **`minNumbers`** (Integer):  \n    The minimum number of numeric digits required in the password.  \n    **Example**: `1` – Password must contain at least one numeric digit.\n    \n8. **`minPasswordDuration`** (Datetime in ISO 8601 format):  \n    Specifies the date until which the password is valid. After this date, the user will be prompted to update their password.  \n    **Example**: `\"2025-01-07T15:43:47.550000Z\"` – The password will expire on January 7, 2025.","descriptionHtml":"#### Description:<br><br>This API allows you to configure and enforce password policies for user accounts.
