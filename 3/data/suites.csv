"#### Description:

This API allows you to configure and enforce password policies for user accounts. The password policy parameters include settings for minimum and maximum password lengths, allowed failed login attempts, password reuse, and specific character requirements such as lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers. This ensures stronger password security for user accounts.

#### Usage:

Use this API to set the password requirements that users must adhere to when creating or updating their passwords. This policy helps to maintain a secure environment by enforcing password complexity and expiration rules.

#### Request Body Parameters:

1. **`minimumLength`** (Integer):  
    Specifies the minimum required length for user passwords.  
    **Example**: `8` – Password must be at least 8 characters long.
    
2. **`maximumLength`** (Integer):  
    Specifies the maximum allowable length for user passwords.  
    **Example**: `16` – Password can be a maximum of 16 characters long.
    
3. **`maxFailedLoginAttempts`** (Integer):  
    The maximum number of failed login attempts allowed before the account is locked or other security measures are triggered.  
    **Example**: `3` – The user account will be locked after 3 failed login attempts.
    
4. **`passwordReuseCount`** (Integer):  
    Defines how many previous passwords a user must cycle through before reusing the same password.  
    **Example**: `1` – Users cannot reuse their last password.
    
5. **`minLowerCaseLength`** (Integer):  
    The minimum number of lowercase letters required in the password.  
    **Example**: `1` – Password must contain at least one lowercase letter.
    
6. **`minSpecialCharacters`** (Integer):  
    The minimum number of special characters (such as `@`, `#`, `$`) required in the password.  
    **Example**: `1` – Password must contain at least one special character.
    
7. **`minNumbers`** (Integer):  
    The minimum number of numeric digits required in the password.  
    **Example**: `1` – Password must contain at least one numeric digit.
    
8. **`minPasswordDuration`** (Datetime in ISO 8601 format):  
    Specifies the date until which the password is valid. After this date, the user will be prompted to update their password.  
    **Example**: `""2025-01-07T15:43:47.550000Z""` – The password will expire on January 7, 2025.","20","Create Password Policy - Required Fields","Core_Banking_QA","Sat Jan 24 16:06:31 UTC 2026","broken","Sat Jan 24 16:06:31 UTC 2026","","Auth","",""

"#### Description:

This API allows you to configure and enforce password policies for user accounts. The password policy parameters include settings for minimum and maximum password lengths, allowed failed login attempts, password reuse, and specific character requirements such as lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers. This ensures stronger password security for user accounts.

#### Usage:

Use this API to set the password requirements that users must adhere to when creating or updating their passwords. This policy helps to maintain a secure environment by enforcing password complexity and expiration rules.

#### Request Body Parameters:

1. **`minimumLength`** (Integer):  
    Specifies the minimum required length for user passwords.  
    **Example**: `8` – Password must be at least 8 characters long.
    
2. **`maximumLength`** (Integer):  
    Specifies the maximum allowable length for user passwords.  
    **Example**: `16` – Password can be a maximum of 16 characters long.
    
3. **`maxFailedLoginAttempts`** (Integer):  
    The maximum number of failed login attempts allowed before the account is locked or other security measures are triggered.  
    **Example**: `3` – The user account will be locked after 3 failed login attempts.
    
4. **`passwordReuseCount`** (Integer):  
    Defines how many previous passwords a user must cycle through before reusing the same password.  
    **Example**: `1` – Users cannot reuse their last password.
    
5. **`minLowerCaseLength`** (Integer):  
    The minimum number of lowercase letters required in the password.  
    **Example**: `1` – Password must contain at least one lowercase letter.
    
6. **`minSpecialCharacters`** (Integer):  
    The minimum number of special characters (such as `@`, `#`, `$`) required in the password.  
    **Example**: `1` – Password must contain at least one special character.
    
7. **`minNumbers`** (Integer):  
    The minimum number of numeric digits required in the password.  
    **Example**: `1` – Password must contain at least one numeric digit.
    
8. **`minPasswordDuration`** (Datetime in ISO 8601 format):  
    Specifies the date until which the password is valid. After this date, the user will be prompted to update their password.  
    **Example**: `""2025-01-07T15:43:47.550000Z""` – The password will expire on January 7, 2025.","18","Create Password Policy - Already Created","Core_Banking_QA","Sat Jan 24 16:06:31 UTC 2026","broken","Sat Jan 24 16:06:31 UTC 2026","","Auth","",""
